This project was completed using a combination of Java SDK v8, JavaFX, Scene Builder 2.0, and IntelliJ IDEA.

As instructed to during class, the finished project folder was zipped up. In same directory as this readme.txt, you will find screenshots of the program completing the requisite tasks from the provided inventory.txt file.

Make sure inventory.txt is in this directory before trying to run the program.

This program was fully tested and works on my machine. If for some reason it doesn't work on the machine you are using, please contact me at wfunk@knights.ucf.edu to see if it is an issue with incompatible IDEs or corruption during transmission.
